I am a full-stack software engineer looking to share knowledge and create positive change in this dynamic industry.

Earning a BSc in Engineering & Business at Warwick University allowed me to acquire and hone a wide range of skills and garnered in me a renewed appreciation for the way software and technology drive development across the wider industrial and sectoral landscape.

Upon graduation, I joined Makers Academy, where I learned how to craft clean, well-tested software while pair programming and working in an agile manner. This ultimately lead me to work in one of the best SaaS companies in the MENA region, BoundlessHR, where I introduced TDD and other industry-leading methodologies as part of the stack.

I am now undertaking the next challenge in my career as a postgraduate student, where I will be focusing on supplementing my experience in the industry with the academic offerings at UCL.

My varied experience, both academic and non-academic have made me highly adaptable and a quick learner that keenly tackles new challenges and opportunities.

I appreciate good design, doesn't matter if it's on the web, print or even architectural. I also can't survive without multi-tasking.
Oh, I forgot to mention that I really like Ruby and its community; RiNSWAN.
