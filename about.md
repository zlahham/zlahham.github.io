During the day, I am a software engineer and consultant at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/), and in the evenings a volunteer teacher at [Code First: Girls](https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/) or [CodeBar](https://codebar.io/).

Earning a BSc in Engineering & Business at Warwick University allowed me to acquire and hone a wide range of skills and garnered in me a renewed appreciation for the way software and technology drive development across the wider industrial and sectoral landscape.

After completing my undergraduate degree, I joined Makers Academy, where I learned how to craft clean, well-tested software while pair programming and working in an agile manner. This ultimately led me to work at one of the best SaaS companies in the MENA region, [ZenHR Solutions](https://www.zenhr.com/), where I introduced TDD and other industry-leading methodologies as part of the stack.

I then returned to the academic space as a postgraduate student at UCL, where I focused on supplementing my experience in the industry with the academic offerings.

My varied experience, both academic and non-academic have made me highly adaptable and a quick learner that keenly tackles new challenges and opportunities and I have been fortunate enought to have worked with a broad spectrum of organisations and teams, from the smallest startups to the largest enterprises.

When it comes to tech, I am an advocate for OSS, test-driven development, 'real' agile processes, and more recently, infrastructure and cloud serverless technologies.
I live and die by 'Software is a Craft' and you can talk to me for hours about vim, Ruby, or the future of education.

I appreciate good design - doesn't matter if it's on the web, print or even architectural. I also can't survive without multi-tasking.
