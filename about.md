During the day, I am a Software Engineering Manager at [Monzo](https://www.monzo.com/), and in the evenings, an Arduino tinkerer, or a wannabe chef.

My day job? I’m usually steering the ship for two awesome teams at Monzo, where we tackle the tricky stuff in financial crime. It's not just about fighting the bad guys; it's about being smart and staying ahead in the game.

I love sharing what I know, building teams that are self-sufficient and high performing, and making sure we're not just ticking boxes but actually making a difference for our customers and the folks we work with.

My journey’s been quite the ride – from accidentally ending up coding away at my desk to a failed startup attempt. Along the way, I've picked up some cool tricks, learned a ton, and had the chance to work with some seriously talented people.

Stay tuned to see what we get up to next at Monzo – it's going to be exciting!
